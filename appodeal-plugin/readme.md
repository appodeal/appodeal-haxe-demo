# Appodeal OpenFL plugin

## 1. Link your Admob account
Appodeal yields optimal results in cooperation with Admob. To continue, you need to link your Admob account.

If you don't have Admob account, please sign up on Admob.com.

To link your Admob account to Appodeal, use the Chrome extension:

INSTALL EXTENSION


The extension source code is available at https://github.com/appodeal/admob-configurator.

The extension will make two changes in your Admob account. First, it will allow Appodeal to access your Admob reports over API, and second, it will create new ad units on Admob and submit them to Appodeal.

VIDEO TUTORIAL

## 2. Download SDK

You can download Appodeal plugin for OpenFL here.

Minimum OS requirements: Android API level 9 (Android OS 2.3).

Android Appodeal SDK version 1.15.5

iOS Appodeal SDK version x.x.x

## 3. AndroidManifest.xml

All required changes to AndroidManifest.xml are already included in the plugin

## 4. OpenFL Integration

### 4.1. SDK files

Download the plugin and unzip it into your project directory. Open project.xml and append the following lines:

```
<haxelib name="extension-admob" />
<include path="./appodeal-plugin" /> 
```

To install extension-admob, you can simply get the library from haxelib like this:

```
haxelib install extension-admob
```

### 4.2. Ad types

Appodeal.INTERSTITIAL

Appodeal.SKIPPABLE_VIDEO

Appodeal.BANNER

Appodeal.REWARDED_VIDEO

Appodeal.NON_SKIPPABLE_VIDEO

Ad types can be combined using "|" operator. For example Appodeal.INTERSTITIAL | Appodeal.SKIPPABLE_VIDEO

Note that it is better to use NON_SKIPPABLE_VIDEO or REWARDED_VIDEO, but if you are sure you want to use SKIPPABLE_VIDEO you must confirm usage by calling Appodeal.confirm(Appodeal.SKIPPABLE_VIDEO) before SDK initialization

### 4.3. SDK initialization

To initialize SDK you need to add following code:

```
var appKey = "fee50c333ff3825fd6ad6d38cff78154de3025546d47a84f";
var bannerRequired = true;
var interstitialRequired = true;
var skippableVideoRequired = true;
var nonSkippableVideoRequired = true;
var rewardedVideoRequired = true;
Appodeal.initialize(appKey, bannerRequired, interstitialRequired, skippableVideoRequired, nonSkippableVideoRequired, rewardedVideoRequired);
```

Note: appKey is the key you received when you created an app.

To initialize only interstitials use Appodeal.initialize(appKey, false, true, false, false, false);

To initialize only skippable videos use Appodeal.initialize(appKey, false, false, true, false, false);

To initialize interstitials and videos use Appodeal.initialize(appKey, false, true, true, false, false);

To initialize only banners use Appodeal.initialize(appKey, true, false, false, false, false);

To initialize only rewarded video use Appodeal.initialize(appKey, false, false, false, false, true);

To initialize only non-skippable video use Appodeal.initialize(appKey, false, false, false, true, false);

### 4.4. Display ad

```
Appodeal.show(adTypes);
```

show() returns a boolean value indicating whether show call was passed to appropriate SDK

To display interstitial use Appodeal.show(Appodeal.INTERSTITIAL)

To display skippable video use Appodeal.show(Appodeal.SKIPPABLE_VIDEO)

To display rewarded video use Appodeal.show(Appodeal.REWARDED_VIDEO)

To display non-skippable video use Appodeal.show(Appodeal.NON_SKIPPABLE_VIDEO)

To display interstitial or video use Appodeal.show(Appodeal.INTERSTITIAL | Appodeal.SKIPPABLE_VIDEO)

To display banner at the bottom of the screen use Appodeal.Show(Appodeal.BANNER_BOTTOM)

To display banner at the top of the screen use Appodeal.show(Appodeal.BANNER_TOP)

### 4.5. Hiding banner

To hide banner you need to call the following code:

```
Appodeal.hide(Appodeal.BANNER);
```

### 4.6. Samples

Display interstitial after it was loaded

```
Appodeal.setAutoCache(Appodeal.INTERSTITIAL, false);
Appodeal.initialize(appKey, false, true, false, false, false);
Appodeal.cache(Appodeal.INTERSTITIAL);
Appodeal.addInterstitialListener("onInterstitialLoaded", onInterstitialReady);

public function onInterstitialReady(){
    Appodeal.show(Appodeal.INTERSTITIAL);
}
```

Display interstitial after app launch

```
Appodeal.initialize(appKey, false, true, false, false, false);
Appodeal.show(Appodeal.INTERSTITIAL);
```

`Note: showing fullscreen ads immediately after app launch doesn't allowed. Also, if an ad has not uploaded yet, you will see a loader, which will be disappeared after few seconds`

```
Appodeal.setAutoCache(adTypes, false);
```

Should be used before SDK initialization

To disable automatic caching for interstitials use Appodeal.setAutoCache(Appodeal.INTERSTITIAL, false)

To disable automatic caching for skippable videos use Appodeal.setAutoCache(Appodeal.SKIPPABLE_VIDEO, false)

Appodeal.setOnLoadedTriggerBoth(adTypes, true);
```

Currently supported only for interstitials

setOnLoadedTriggerBoth(Appodeal.INTERSTITIAL, false) - onInterstitialLoaded will trigger only when normal ad was loaded (default).

setOnLoadedTriggerBoth(Appodeal.INTERSTITIAL, true) - onInterstitialLoaded will trigger twice, both when precache and normal ad were loaded.

Should be used before SDK initialization.

#### Disabling networks

```
Appodeal.disableNetwork("networkName");
```

Also, itâ€™s possible to disable network only for specific ad types.
